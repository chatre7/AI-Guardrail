    # On Linux, this makes the containerized app communicate with the host's Ollama instance.
    # For Windows/Mac, Ollama running on the host is accessible via `host.docker.internal`.
    # You might need to adjust the OLLAMA_HOST environment variable inside your application
    # or here if the default (localhost) doesn't work.
    extra_hosts:
      - "host.docker.internal:host-gateway"

# Note: This setup assumes you are running the Ollama service on your host machine.
# To run Ollama as a separate container, you would define another service here
# and configure the chatbot_api to point to it.
